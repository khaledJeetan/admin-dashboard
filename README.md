# Frontend Web Dashboard for Admin Account (Under Development)

Welcome to the Frontend Web Dashboard for the Admin Account project! This dashboard is designed to provide an intuitive user interface for managing various aspects of your application. The dashboard is developed using Vue.js 3, Vuetify, Pinia, and Vue Router for navigation. Please note that this project is still under development, and not all features are functional at this time.

## Project Overview

This frontend dashboard is part of a project that includes a backend, which has been developed separately. You can find the backend code in the [graduation-project](https://github.com/khaledJeetan/graduation-project) repository. The goal of this dashboard is to seamlessly interact with the backend services and facilitate efficient management of your application.
